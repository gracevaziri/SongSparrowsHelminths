Variable and descriptions: 
Date = date in MM/DD/YYYY
WA.time = time in Washington state
Transmitter.date = date a transmitter was placed on bird
Transmitter_on = time a transmitter was placed on bird
Channel = channel used to track transmitter
freq = frequency of signal emitted by transmitter
bird_id = band number for bird a transmitter was attached to
antihel = Y yes or N no whether a bird was treated with anthelmintic drugs
LPS = Y yes or N no whether a bird was injected with LPS
"comb_trt = combination of two preceding variables, separated by ""_"""
shed_at_least_once = whether a bird shed helminth eggs in its feces at least one time
shed_twice = whether a bird shed helminth eggs in its feces two times
BPM = the beats per minute detected by the receiver from the transmitter
PI = the inter pulse interval detected by the receiver from the transmitter
slope = the slope associated with each transmitter's specific equation
intercept = the intercept associated with each transmitter's specific equation
temp = the bird's body temperature as converted from the PI 
temp_change = the change in a bird's temperature from one recording to the next
Antenna = the antenna from which the most high quality recordings were recovered
Power = the signal strength of each signal emitted by a transmitter
